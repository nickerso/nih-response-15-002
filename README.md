## If you want to edit directly from here, in your browser

The main content file is `body.tex`.  Click on the file name in the list above.  GitHub will present an editing interface.  Look near the top of the file for the pencil icon,

and click on it.  Before going further, you will want to change the editor settings.  Look again in the same upper right hand area for the new set of buttons:

Do 3 things: (1) click the "nowrap" button and select "Soft wrap" from the pop-up menu, (2) click the "spaces" button and select "Tabs" from the menu, and finally, (3) click the "2" and change the indent size to "8".

(Sorry, there's no way to set defaults for GitHub's editor.)
